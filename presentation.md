*   **🔒 Data Silos**: Your hard work is locked in centralized apps (Slack, Jira, GitHub).
*   **📉 Zero Motivation**: Remote work feels lonely and unrewarding.
*   **👁️ Surveillance**: Traditional trackers spy on you.
*   **💸 No Ownership**: You generate data, companies monetize it.

## 💎 Shelby Integration: "The Secret Sauce"

We solve the **Privacy vs. Verification** paradox.

1.  **Local App**: Captures activity (e.g., "Coding for 2h").
2.  **Encryption**: Encrypts data with **User's Wallet Key**.
3.  **Shelby Upload**: Stores encrypted blob on decentralized nodes.
4.  **Aptos Proof**: Submits `blob_id` + `score` to smart contract.

✅ **Result**: Public Proof, Private Data.
